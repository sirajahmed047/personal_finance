## 📊 Current Status: Phase 1

Phase 1 delivers a minimal viable product (MVP) with three main tabs—Debt Tracker, Expense Tracker, and Net Worth—optimized for both mobile and desktop compatibility. The app is built as a PWA, ensuring offline functionality and installability.

### Features

#### 1. Debt Tracker
- **Debt Management**:
  - Add debts with details: name, principal amount, interest rate, duration (months), start date, and an "Allow Extra Payments" toggle.
  - Delete debts with a dedicated button.
  - Backdated loans auto-generate EMI payments from the start date to the current date.
- **Payment Management**:
  - Record payments with amount and date in an expandable payments section.
  - Validation:
    - If "Allow Extra Payments" is unchecked: Only one EMI payment per month, equal to the calculated EMI.
    - If checked: Payments can be any amount up to the remaining total debt (principal + interest).
  - Payments history accessible via a modal to save screen space.
- **Debt Details**:
  - Minimal view shows loan amount and progress bar; expands on click to show EMI, remaining balance, total debt (principal + interest), and remaining EMIs.
  - Total debt amount calculated as EMI * duration, accounting for interest.
  - Progress bar reflects percentage of total debt paid (principal + interest).
- **Notifications**:
  - Dashboard notifications (bell icon) display payment additions, replacing console logs.

#### 2. Expense Tracker
- **Expense Management**:
  - Log daily expenses with amount, category (dropdown), and date.
  - Delete expenses with a button next to each entry.
  - Categories: Fuel, Transport, Health, Food, Shopping, Entertainment, Bills, Other.
- **Income Management**:
  - Minimal view shows a single "Enter Monthly Income" input field; expands on click to reveal current income and additional incomes (if any).
  - Additional income feature allows logging one-time incomes with amount and date.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - View expenses by month using a date picker (e.g., "YYYY-MM").
  - Pie chart displays category-wise spending for the selected month.
  - Last 5 transactions shown for quick reference.
- **Calculations**:
  - Total spent and percentage of monthly income for the current month.

#### 3. Net Worth
- **Asset Management**:
  - Add assets with name and value, stored locally.
- **Liability Calculation**:
  - Total liabilities reflect the remaining total debt amount (principal + interest minus payments), not just principal.
- **Net Worth**:
  - Dynamic calculation: Total Assets - Total Liabilities.
  - Displayed with assets and liabilities breakdown.

### Technical Features
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**:
  - Offline functionality via service workers.
  - Installable on mobile and desktop devices.

- **Authentication**: Add OAuth (Google, X, email) with account login.
- **Net Worth Enhancements**: Income target projections, profile analysis, historical charts.
- **Expense Tracker Enhancements**: Budget setting, detailed category analysis.
- **Data Export/Import**: Allow users to backup and restore their data.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement theme switching for better user experience.

### Phase 3 (Future)
- **API Integrations**: Connect to Upstox and Zerodha for investment data.
- **Backend**: Introduce a server for secure data storage and API handling.
- **Multi-device Sync**: Synchronize data across multiple devices.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide insights and recommendations based on spending patterns.

## 🔒 Security Notes

### 📝 Notes for Future Development
- **Phase 2 Preparation**: The current structure supports easy extension (e.g., adding authentication or charts). Expand `storage.js` for backend integration later.
- **Phase 3 Considerations**: Plan API endpoints for Upstox/Zerodha now to ensure data models align (e.g., investment categories in Net Worth).
- **Code Quality**: Refactor repetitive code (e.g., modal logic) into reusable components as the app grows.
